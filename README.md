Student Management System
The Student Management System was developed as part of my Diploma course assignment.
Built using C# Windows Forms with an integrated local database, the system allows you to manage student records, including creating, editing, and deleting entries.

About the Project
Hello, Furqan here again!
This time, I’ve built a Student Management System as part of my Diploma coursework.
It’s a simple desktop application, nothing too complicated, designed to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student data.

How to Run the Project
Step 1: Install Visual Studio
Make sure you have Visual Studio (not Visual Studio Code) installed on your computer.

Step 2: Download the Project
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Step 3: Open the Project
Open the solution folder in Visual Studio.

Step 4: Connect the Database
Go to View > Server Explorer > Connect to Database.
(If you're familiar with Visual Studio, this step should be easy.)

Step 5: Run the Project
Click the Start button (the green play button at the top) to run the application.

Important Notes
The database file is located in the database folder (inside the project directory).

You must update the connection string in your code. The current connection string points to a path on my personal laptop, so it won’t work on your system unless updated.
